Q3
This program is used to group each point according to their distance to each center.

First, I get a function to calculate their distance to each center, put the point into the group closest to itself. Then to update the points, I generate a function calculate the mean of the coordinate of the point inside of each group.

Lastly, I get a loop to iterate the whole process for 1000 times.
As it shows in the graph, It seems that the model acts well.
