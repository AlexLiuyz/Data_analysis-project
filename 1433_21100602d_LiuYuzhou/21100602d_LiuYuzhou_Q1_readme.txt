This program is aim to use montecarlo model to estimulate the whole process, through a huge amount of experiment.

I use number 1:100 to stand for the 100 different type of cards, then to have 500 cards can be seen as choose 1 card from those 100 different kinds of cards with replacement, then I use 100 and 99 to represent the cards Agrippa and Ptolemy.
And I stimulate it 1000, 100000, 4000000 times. it shows 0,2e-05,3.7e-05.Seems better  as time increase.
